 The user profiles are saved in a database - the project requires a node.js backend.

 User begins with 3 cards , one of type rock, one of type paper, one of type scissors.
 User can add more cards to her deck, by defeating enemies, like the serpent.
 There are 32 counties. Each county can have one Taoiseach or 'Chieftain', and one Táiniste or 'Second in command';
 If you are the first player to Enter a County, you can challenge the Chieftain. If there is no Chieftain, and you are not already a Chieftain of another County; you are automatically offered Chieftainship of the County. If you accept, The Book of the County Enters a new entry declaring the new Chieftain; and the latest news updates with this info. As Chieftain, you have access to the County Settings menu.
 
If another player challenges your claim to chieftainship of the County;
his challenge is added to the Challenge queue.
A chieftain can not begin a new round until the County Challenge queue is empty or she withdraws her claim to Chieftainship.

Challenges are rock-paper-scissors games between players. Chieftain challenges are played 'for keeps', and the game ends when one player runs out of cards or retreats. A Chieftain who retreats loses command of the county (but may still be Chieftain of another county).
